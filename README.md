# ft_container
Reimplement some of the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++;

# Objectifs
In this project, you will implement a few container types of the C++ standard template
library.
You have to take the structure of each standard container as reference. If a part of
the Orthodox Canonical form is missing in it, do not implement it.
As a reminder, you have to comply with the C++98 standard, so any later feature of
the containers MUST NOT be implemented, but every C++98 feature (even deprecated
ones) is expected.

## Description of the containers to be reimplemented.
### Vector
 > Vectors are sequence containers representing arrays that can change in size.
### Stack
 > Stacks are a type of container adaptor, specifically designed to operate in a LIFO context (last-in first-out), where elements are inserted and extracted only from one end of the container.
### Map
 > Maps are associative containers that store elements formed by a combination of a key value and a mapped value, following a specific order.
